Subject: app_confbridge

app_confbridge now has the ability to force the estimated bitrate on an SFU
bridge.  To use it, set a bridge profile's remb_behavior to "force" and
set remb_estimated_bitrate to a rate in bits per second.  The
remb_estimated_bitrate parameter is ignored if remb_behavior is something
other than "force".

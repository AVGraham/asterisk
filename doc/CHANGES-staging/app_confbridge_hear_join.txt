Subject: app_confbridge

Added the hear_own_join_sound option to the confbridge user profile to
control who hears the sound_join audio file. When set to 'yes' the user
entering the conference and the participants already in the conference
will hear the sound_join audio file. When set to 'no' the user entering
the conference will not hear the sound_join audio file, but the
participants already in the conference will hear the sound_join audio file.

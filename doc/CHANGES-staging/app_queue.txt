Subject: app_queue

Introduce a new queue configuration option called
'periodic-announce-startdelay' which will vary the normal (historic) behavior
of starting the periodic announcement cycle at periodic-announce-frequency
seconds after entering the queue to start the periodic announcement cycle at
period-announce-startdelay seconds after joining the queue.

The default behavior if this config option is not set remains unchanged.

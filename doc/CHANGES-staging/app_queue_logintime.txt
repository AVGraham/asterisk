Subject: app_queue

Add field to save the time value when a member enter a queue.
Shows this time in seconds using 'queue show' command and the
field LoginTime for responses for AMI the events.

The output for the CLI command `queue show` is changed by added a
extra data field for the information of the time login time for each
member.

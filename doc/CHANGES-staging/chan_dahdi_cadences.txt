Subject: chan_dahdi

Previously, cadences were appended on dahdi restart,
rather than reloaded. This prevented cadences from
being updated and maxed out the available cadences
if reloaded multiple times. This behavior is fixed
so that reloading cadences is idempotent and cadences
can actually be reloaded.

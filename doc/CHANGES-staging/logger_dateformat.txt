Subject: logger

The dateformat option in logger.conf will now control the remote
console (asterisk -r -T) timestamp format.  Previously, dateformat only
controlled the formatting of the timestamp going to log files and the
main console (asterisk -c) but only for non-verbose messages.

Internally, Asterisk does not send the logging timestamp with verbose
messages to console clients. It's up to the Asterisk remote consoles
to format verbose messages.  Asterisk remote consoles previously did
not load dateformat from logger.conf.

Previously there was a non-configurable and hard-coded "%b %e %T"
dateformat that would be used no matter what on all verbose console
messages printed on remote consoles.

Example:
logger.conf
 dateformat=%F %T.%3q

# asterisk -rvvv -T
[2021-03-19 09:54:19.760-0400]  Loading res_stasis_answer.so.
[Mar 19 09:55:43]     -- Goto (dialExten,s,1)

Given the following example configuration in logger.conf, Asterisk log
files and the console, will log verbose messages using the given
timestamp.  Now ensuring that all remote console messages are logged
with the same dateformat as other log streams.

---
[general]
dateformat=%F %T.%3q

[logfiles]
console  => notice,warning,error,verbose
full     => notice,warning,error,debug,verbose
---

Now we have a globally-defined dateformat that will be used
consistently across the Asterisk main console, remote consoles, and
log files.

Now we have consistent logging:

# asterisk -rvvv -T
[2021-03-19 09:54:19.760-0400]  Loading res_stasis_answer.so.
[2021-03-19 09:55:43.920-0400]     -- Goto (dialExten,s,1)

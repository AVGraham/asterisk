The location where the media cache stores its temporary files
is no longer hardcoded to /tmp but can now be configured separately
via the astcachedir config variable in asterisk.conf.

The default location for astcachedir is now /var/cache/asterisk
instead of /tmp, please make sure to manually cleanup and/or
migrate the temporary files in /tmp after upgrading.

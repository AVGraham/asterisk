Subject: MessageSend

The MessageSend dialplan application now takes an
optional third argument that can set the message's
"To" field on outgoing messages.  It's an alternative
to using the MESSAGE(to) dialplan function.

To prevent confusion with the first argument, currently
named "to", it's been renamed to "destination".
Its function, creating the request URI, hasn't changed.

The online documentation has also been enhanced to
explain the behavior.

Despite the changes in this commit, there should be
no impact to current users of MessageSend.

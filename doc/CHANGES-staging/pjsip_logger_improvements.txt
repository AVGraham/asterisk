Subject: res_pjsip_logger

The PJSIP packet logger now has the following CLI commands:

pjsip set logger pcap <filename>

When used this will create a pcap file containing the incoming
and outgoing SIP packets, in unencrypted form.

pjsip set logger console <on / off>

This allows you to toggle logging to console on and off.

pjsip set logger host <IP/subnet mask> add

This allows you to add an additional IP address or subnet
mask to logging, allowing you to log multiple instead of
just a single IP address or all traffic.

The normal "pjsip set logger host" CLI command has also been
expanded to allow subnet masks as well.

Subject: res_geolocation

Added 4 built-in profiles:
  "<prefer_config>"
  "<discard_config>"
  "<prefer_incoming>"
  "<discard_incoming>"
The profiles are empty except for having their precedence
set.

Added profile parameter "suppress_empty_ca_elements" that
will cause Civic Address elements that are empty to be
suppressed from the outgoing PIDF-LO document.

You can now specify the location object's format, location_info,
method, location_source and confidence parameters directly on
a profile object for simple scenarios where the location
information isn't common with any other profiles.  This is
mutually exclusive with setting location_reference on the
profile.

Added an 'a' option to the GEOLOC_PROFILE function to allow
variable lists like location_info_refinement to be appended
to instead of replacing the entire list.

Added an 'r' option to the GEOLOC_PROFILE function to resolve all
variables before a read operation and after a Set operation.

Subject: res_geolocation

Added 4 built-in profiles:
  "<prefer_config>"
  "<discard_config>"
  "<prefer_incoming>"
  "<discard_incoming>"
The profiles are empty except for having their precedence
set.

Added profile parameter "suppress_empty_ca_elements" that
will cause Civic Address elements that are empty to be
suppressed from the outgoing PIDF-LO document.

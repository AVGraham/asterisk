Subject: PlaybackFinished has a new error state

The PlaybackFinished event now has a new state "failed"
that is used when the sound file was not played due to an error.
Before the state on PlaybackFinished was always "done".

In case of multiple sound files to be played,
the PlaybackFinished is sent only once in the end of the list,
even in case of error.

Subject: res_sorcery_memory_cache

The SorceryMemoryCacheExpireObject AMI action and CLI
command allow expiring of a specific object within the
sorcery memory cache. This is done by removing the
object from the cache with the expectation that the
cache will then re-populate the object when it is next
needed.

For full backend caching this does not occur. The cache
won't repopulate until an entire refresh is done resulting
in the possibility that objects are missing until that
time.

The AMI action and CLI command will now not allow
expiring of an object if the cache is configured as a
full backend cache. Instead you must use either the
SorceryMemoryCacheExpire or SorceryMemoryCachePopulate
AMI actions or their associated CLI commands.

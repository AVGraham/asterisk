Subject: STIR/SHAKEN

STIR/SHAKEN support has been added to Asterisk. Configuration is done in
stir_shaken.conf. There is a sample configuration file to help you get
started (asterisk/configs/samples/stir_shaken.conf.sample). Once that's
set up, you can enable STIR/SHAKEN on any endpoint by setting stir_shaken
to yes on the endpoint configuration object. This will add an Identity
header on outgoing INVITEs, and check for an Identity header on incoming
INVITEs. This option has been added to Alembic as well.

The information received on an incoming INVITE can be checked using the
STIR_SHAKEN dialplan function. There are two variations:

STIR_SHAKEN(count)
STIR_SHAKEN(0, verify_result)

The first variation will tell you how many STIR/SHAKEN results are on the
channel. The second fetches information for a specific result. The first
parameter is the index, followed by what information you want to retrieve.
The available options are 'verify_result', 'identity', and 'attestation'.

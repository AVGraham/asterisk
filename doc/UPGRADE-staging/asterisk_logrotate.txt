Subject: Log Rotate
Master-Only: True

The sample logger files have been changed to have .log as their file
extension. This was done so that when attached to issues on the issue
tracker, they are able to be opened in the browser for convenience.
Because of this, the asterisk.logrotate script has been updated to look
for .log extensions instead of no extension for files such as full
and messages.

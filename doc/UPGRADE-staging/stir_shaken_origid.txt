Subject: STIR/SHAKEN

STIR/SHAKEN originally needed an origid to be specified in
stir_shaken.conf under the certificate config object in
order to work. Now, one is automatically created by
generating a UUID, as recommended by RFC8588. Any origid
you have in your stir_shaken.conf will need to be removed
for the module to read in certificates.
